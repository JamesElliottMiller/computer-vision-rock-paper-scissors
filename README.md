# Computer Vision RPS

## First Steps

So as a part of this computer vision project I've used https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train/image to make an image recognition model recognising 4 different states:

1. Rock (Hands in a balled up position)

2. Paper (Palm flat, fingers pointed out)

3. Scissors (index and middle fingers extender, else balled fist)

and
4. Nothing (no hands in shot)

I've exported this data into a labels and keras model h5 file.
